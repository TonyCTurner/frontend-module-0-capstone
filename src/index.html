  <h1>Why I love web development</h1>
  <p>I knew when I was 16 that I wanted to be an engineer. At the time, there was no such thing as the web.
    All that existed was primitive point to point connections between universities and military complexes.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>While going through university, a new discipline was introduced, computer science. It was a very early
    version of what today is a vast science covering multiple areas of study. Back then, though, there was
    just Computer Science.</p>
  <p>I built my first assembler, and watched as something I created in class take a file full of assembly
    language, which we also created, and assemble it into machine code. It was amazing to see the computer
    take this machine code, run it, and get a real output, from a language and an assembler that each of us
    invented out of thin air! I was hooked.</p>
  <p>Very quickly, there came a plethora of languages, as folks experimented with new compilers and
    interpreters</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Forth</li>
    <li>Pascal</li>
    <li>ADA</li>
    <li>various assembly languages for different hardware platforms such as the 8080 and the motorolla chipsets</li>
    <li>Then, along came C</li>
    <li>And not too long afterwards, a very strange language that used a remarkable new technology,
      object oriented c++</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Software was never the same. Procedural languages fell by the wayside like Pascal, replaced by
    object oriented Pascal.</p>
  <p>I remember moving to Colorado, and working in my office in the basement. I became aware of
    technology advancements that created this strange thing called the World Wide Web. I began using it,
    and fell in love with static html. what an amazing thing. Soon came:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>css</li>
    <li>and then a strange language called Javascript</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and the web came alive. Internet speeds were phenomenal, finally moving from 9600 baud to 19.2k baud! we were all amazed by this blinding speed. Harddrives grew to a wopping 10M, who would ever need more? Then, it happened:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DSL was born</li>
    <li>CPUs doubled in speed</li>
    <li>the first 100M harddrive came out for a mere $2000</li>
  </ul>
  <p>, and off we went.</p>
  <h2>Today</h2>
  <p>It has been many years since then, and I find <span class="emphasis">I still can't get enough of it.</span> New technologies come out all the time, moving the art forward inch by inch.</p>
